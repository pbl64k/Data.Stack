Just some pointless arrow acrobatics. This lib provides a few funky
combinators, some basic operations on stacks and pairs of stacks, as well
as PairStack type transforming a stack of a values into a stack of (a, a)
tuples purely on the interface level. The dd combinator employs this to
some effect, lifting type-agnostic stack operation to operate on pairs of
values, e.g.:

*Data.Stack Control.Applicative Control.Arrow> (push' 1 >>> push' 2 >>> push' 3 >>> push' 4 >>> dd over) []
[2,1,4,3,2,1]
